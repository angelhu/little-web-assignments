    <h2>ONEHOPE Sparkling Wine</h2>
    <p class="title">From <span class="state">California</span></p>
    <p class="description">I’m known for my bubbly personality. I’m also a little sweet, like the peach emoji IRL. I love any excuse to be the life of the party. I’d love to meet your friends before we go dancing. "If I’m vinegar, then you must be baking soda. Because you make me feel all bubbly inside."</p>

    <h2>Electric Red</h2>
    <p class="title">From <span class="state">California</span></p>
    <p class="description">I'm a full-bodied American with deep European roots. I've got a sweet red fruity personality with a warm (wintery spicy) heart. For our first date, I'm easy – all I need is a happy hour with a good cheese plate. "Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you all the cheese disappears."</p>

    <h2>Pierre et Papa</h2>
    <p class="title">From <span class="state">South of France</span></p>
    <p class="description">Let’s pretend it’s summer all year long. I like long walks on the beach, key lime pie, and anything with coconut. Bring me with you on your next vacay. "If you like pina coladas, and gettin caught in the rain, then I’m the love that you’ve looked for, drink with me and escape."</p>
